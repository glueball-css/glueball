  <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
  <p>
    Glueball offers a verstile system of breakpoints to optimize layouts and
    interfaces for different viewport sizes.  We offer sensible defaults and
    naming conventions, while full customization per module is made easy. Refer
    to the module documentation or CSS code to see their settings.
  </p>

  <h3>Responsive webdesign</h3>
  <p>
    The unit for the (default) breakpoints is <code>{{ breakpoints._unit }}</code>.
  </p>

  <table>
    <caption>List of breakpoints</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>bp</th>
        <th>from</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    {% for bp in breakpoints.media_table() %}
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>{{ bp[0] }}</td>
          <td class="ta-r">{{ bp[1] }}{{ breakpoints._unit }}</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    {% endfor %}
  </table>

  <p>
    Breakpoints are applied by prefixing them to selectors. The breakpoints that form the
    lower and upper bound are followed by an underscore.
    To set <code>size5</code> only between breakpoints <code>m</code>
    and <code>l</code>, the selector becomes:<code>ml_size5</code>. This corresponds to the
    following CSS code:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
@media (min-width: 48em) and (max-width: 74.99em) {
    .ml_size5 { font-size: 1.5rem; }
}
  </code></pre>

  <h4>Mobile first</h4>
  <p>
    The pattern above is not very common, as we rely mainly on media-queries with only lower
    bounds. This "mobile first" approach is common modern CSS frameworks. We do not include
    the top breakpoint <q>{{ breakpoints._index[-1] }}</q> as upper limit (it is implied). When
    no media selector is given, full width is implied.
  </p>
<pre><code>
.pr5 { padding-right: 1rem; }

@media (min-width: 36em) {
    .s_pr5 { padding-right: 1.5rem; }
}
</code></pre>

  <p>This is an overview of all possible prefixes for the default breakpoints. The colored bar
  shows in which range the styles are applied.</p>
  {% set media = breakpoints.media_table() %}
  {% set bps = breakpoints.bp_table(breakpoints.media_up()+breakpoints.media_down()+breakpoints.media_only()+breakpoints.media_other()) %}
  <table>
    <caption>Media prefixes</caption>
    {% include 'includes/media-table.html' %}
  </table>
  
  <h4>Pseudo selectors</h4>
  <p>
    Pseudo selectors can be styled independently and have the media prefixes applied
    independently.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
@media (min-width: 36em) {
    .s_hover_red70:hover { color: hsl(0, 70%, 50%); }
}
  </code></pre>




  <h3>Customize breakpoints</h3>
  <p>
    Glueball is much more flexible when it comes to breakpoints than Bootstrap or Tachyions.
    It's simply a matter of editing settings to apply breakpoints to modules, to change the
    name and number of breakpoints, their dimensions and their unit.
    It is even possible to manage multiple sets of breakpoints throughout your project.
  </p>

  <h4>Module breakpoints</h4>
  <p>
    Breakpoints are applied to modules by passing them as a list of media queries.
    The media query is a string composed of upper and lower breakpoint:
    <code>["tx", "ss"]</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This may stop working as expected when the name or number of breakpoints is altered.
    We are also seeing recurring patterns of media queries, which would have to be typed
    out for every module. For these reasons, the breakpoints class provides shortcut methods
    for common breakpoint patterns:
  </p>

  {% for cptn, mthd in [
    ['media_full',  breakpoints.media_full],
    ['media_up',    breakpoints.media_up],
    ['media_down',  breakpoints.media_down],
    ['media_other', breakpoints.media_other],
  ] %}

    <table class="my6 collapse tbs0">
      <caption class="tcs-b mt3 gray-35">{{ cptn }}</caption>
      {% set bps = breakpoints.bp_table(mthd()) %}
      {% include 'includes/media-table.html' %}
    </table>

  {% endfor %}
